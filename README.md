# HardloopWebApp

This web application is built as the final project for Harvard's CS50x course.

## What does this application do?

In Dutch "hardlopen" means "to run". So a "HardloopWebApp" is a "running web app". With this application you can upload and store the time and distance of each walk or jog. It will feature a connection to Graphhopper to easily track your route and see the distance traversed. In your dashboard you can see some extra values like average speed.
